## Presentation

This package provides a way to keep a value and update it based on a stream or an initialization
function.

The main goal is to have a unified way to have an object to keep a value in the codebase.

Thanks to this package, we can have a value that is automatically updated based on a stream and
which emits an event when the value is updated.
